# Simple Battleship Game - Progressive Task

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Battleship Game - Progressive Task! This project is a multi-step implementation of the classic Battleship game. In Task 1, the game was implemented with a single-line ship, and now, in Task 2, the game evolves to a complete grid-based version. The code published in this repository represents the full implementation as it progresses through these tasks.

## Phase Explanation

**Phase 1 - Single-Line Battleship (Task 1):**
In Phase 1, the game was a simplified version with a single-line ship represented in a 1-dimensional array of 7 cells. The user's objective was to guess the location of the ship with integer inputs.

**Phase 2 - Complete Grid Battleship (Task 2):**
In Phase 2, the game advances to a more complex version with a complete grid-based structure. The user now interacts with a two-dimensional array representing the sea where the computer places its fleet of ships.

**Phase 3 - Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version (Project 2):**
The third phase of the project introduces a graphical user interface, enhancing the gaming experience. Users can now enjoy the Battleship game with a more interactive and visually appealing interface. This phase corresponds to Project 2.
